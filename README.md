   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Quizzoo App

## Logo Implementation Guide

Buffalo logo files needed:

1. **App Icon**: `assets/images/buffalo-icon.png`
   - Square format (1024Ã—1024px)
   - Used in app stores and as main app icon

2. **Favicon**: `assets/images/buffalo-favicon.png`
   - Small square format (32Ã—32px)
   - Used in web browsers

3. **Adaptive Icon**: `assets/images/buffalo-adaptive-icon.png`
   - Foreground image for Android (108Ã—108px)
   - Keep important content in center circle (72px diameter)

4. **Splash Screen Icon**: `assets/images/buffalo-splash-icon.png`
   - High resolution version (at least 200px width)
   - Used on app loading screen

## Implementation Status

**Current Status**: Temporary placeholder files have been created with the buffalo-prefix. These files need to be replaced with properly optimized versions of the buffalo logo.

## Next Steps:

1. Use the buffalo image from `photo_2025-03-18_16-21-42.jpg` to create optimized versions for each format
2. Replace the temporary files with the properly sized/formatted buffalo logo
3. Ensure each file is saved in PNG format with transparency where appropriate
4. Test the app on different devices to verify logo appearance

For best results:
- Keep transparent backgrounds for adaptive icon
- Ensure the favicon is clear even at small sizes
- Make sure the splash icon looks good on a white background
